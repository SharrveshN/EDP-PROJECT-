MODULE 1 - MOBILE PHONE DETECTOR 


INTRODUCTION : 

•Cell phone detector is a handy, pocket sized mobile detector which is one of the most common electronic equipment used in modern era.
•A cell phone transmits signal‘s range between 0.9 to 3 Ghz.
•A cell phone detector detects the activity of a cell phone by detecting the incoming and outgoing calls and messages.

ABSTRACT :

Mobile phones can cause problems in sensitive areas such as exam halls and secure facilities by 
enabling cheating, security breaches, and equipment interference. Effective detection is crucial to address these issues. 
Current solutions like manual checks, signal jammers, and RF detectors are limited by inefficiency, legality concerns, and range. 
This project aims to develop a more efficient, costeffective mobile phone detector to overcome these limitations and enhance security and operational integrity.

ADVANTAGES :

•Security: Prevents unauthorized mobile phone usage in sensitive areas.
•Integrity: Maintains fairness in exams by detecting phones.
•Cost Effective: More affordable than other detection methods.
•Effective Range: Detects phones even in standby mode.

APPLICATIONS :

•Schools: Prevents cheating in exams.
•Secure Facilities: Stops unauthorized communication.
•Hospitals: Prevents interference with medical equipment.



MODULE 2 - LASER SECURITY SYSTEM 


INTRODUCTION :

Laser security systems use advanced laser technology to create an invisible barrier around a protected area. 
By detecting any disturbances in the laser beams, these systems provide precise and reliable intrusion alerts. 
They offer a high level of accuracy, reduce false alarms, and are ideal for various security needs, from residential to highsecurity environments.

ABSTRACT : 

Laser security systems create invisible barriers to detect unauthorized access, providing enhanced security for sensitive areas. 
They are effective in various conditions but can be affected by environmental factors and may be costly. This project aims to develop an advanced 
laser security system that addresses these limitations, offering a reliable and affordable solution to improve protection and prevent breaches.

ADVANTAGES :

•Reduced False Alarms: Fewer false alerts.
•Wide Coverage: Protects large areas with minimal infrastructure.
•Customizable: Adapts to different environments.
•Non Intrusive: Invisible barriers with no physical obstructions.
•Integrative: Works with other security systems.

APPLICATIONS : 

•Commercial Buildings
•Residential Properties
•Industrial Facilities
•Military and Government Sites
•Research Facilities
•Museums and Art Galleries
